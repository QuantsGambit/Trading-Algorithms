The idea behind Fianchetto was to utilize the direction of a Moving Average to gain an alpha over Standard Moving Average 
crossover strategies. while using larger Moving Average to filter out trading against the trend only allowing longs, or 
only shorts. We also gain an edge by using a Volatility factor to the Moving Average filtering out white noise throughout
the trade. Here is a link to the [TradingView Strategy](https://www.tradingview.com/script/vCEoFf0a-Fianchetto-v1/)
